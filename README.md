story-slicer
============

Story Slicer is an experimental runtime library and visual editor to author non-linear media applications for the web. 

The project was started during Codebits 2012, a 48 hour programming hackathon, as a rewrite of the engine used to create [Corrupt Ladder](http://github.com/no-ninjas/corrupt-ladder) and is still very much a work in progress. Here's what you will find in the repo:

## doc

 * some info regarding the data structures that compose a story in the Story Slicer engine.

## editor

 * a functional prototype of a visual editor for the Story Slicer engine

## engine

 * an *very* early outline of the standalone Story Slicer engine.
